# Two Factor Authentication via SMS in Node.js

## Overview

Two Factor Authentication (2FA) can provide your users effective protection against many security threats that target user passwords and accounts. This application will generate a one-time password that is sent to the recipient's phone number via SMS. Application developers can enable two-factor authentication for their users with ease and without making any changes to the already existing application logic or database structure!
