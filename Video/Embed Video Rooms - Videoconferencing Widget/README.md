ðŸ“– [Read the full guide](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/docs/embed-video-rooms)

The SignalWire Video APIs give you full flexibility to build your own personalized video conferencing experience. But if you just need a basic video-conference widget, you can get started by copy-pasting a **Video Room Widget** from your SignalWire space. Video Rooms can be embedded in your CMS like **WordPress**, **Drupal**, or any other kind of **static HTML page**, simply by **copy-pasting** a snippet of HTML code.

# Running the code

Simply open [index.html](index.html) in your browser. We have configured a room with a demo account. **Make sure to replace the code snipped with your own!**
