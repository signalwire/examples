# Using the AppKit with Angular

This is the integration example of AppKit with Angular. The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

Using the Angular CLI, you can run `ng serve` for a dev server which you can access at `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

For a full guide to this implementation, see the blog [Video Conference AppKit: Vue 3 Integration](https://signalwire.com/blogs/developers/video-conference-appkit-with-angular).
