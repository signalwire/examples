# What do I need to run this code?

- Basic understanding of the Javascript framework
- A NodeJS Environment
- [Express](https://expressjs.com) to handle the web framework

Additionally, you will need a SignalWire account which you can create [here](https://m.signalwire.com/signups/new?s=1). You will also need your SignalWire API
credentials which you can find in the `API` tab of your SignalWire dashboard. For more information on navigating your SignalWire space check [here](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/docs/navigating-your-space)

# How to Run Application

The Multi-factor authentication application is built using [Express](https://expressjs.com), ExpressJs is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features
for web applications and mobile applications.

Follow the below steps to get started with this guide:

- Clone project
- Run `npm install`
- In the project folder there is a `.env.example` file which you can use to create your `.env` file and replace the content with necessary credentials like we mentioned in the prerequisite section.
- Run the project typing the following command in your terminal `node index.js` or `nodemon index.js` if you have [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) installed

This application has two components `index.js` which is our "server" component, and a `frontend` folders which holds all of our static files like (index.html, css files, e.tc.) which is our client component.
