# Two Factor Authentication via SMS in Python

## Overview
Two Factor Authentication (2FA) can provide your users effective protection against many security threats that target user passwords and accounts. This application will generate a One-Time Password that is sent to the recipient's phone number via SMS. Application developers can enable two-factor authentication for their users with ease and without making any changes to the already existing application logic or database structure!

View the full walkthrough on our developer site [here](https://developer.signalwire.com/apis/docs/two-factor-authentication)!

This guide uses the Python SignalWire SDK, for a guide on installation click [here](https://developer.signalwire.com/compatibility-api/reference/client-libraries-and-sdks#python).

You will need a SignalWire phone number as well as your API Credentials (API Token, Space URL, and Project ID) which can all be found in an easily copyable format within the API tab of your SignalWire portal.
