### To run this sample

1. Fill in the Project ID and the API token from your SignalWire dashboard in the `.env.sample` file.
2. Buy a number from the SignalWire Dashboard, configure it to use Relay with context `office`.
3. Add that number to the `.env.sample` file under `PHONE_NUMBER`.
4. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.
5. Run this with `yarn install` then `yarn start` in the project directory.
   Alternatively, you can use Docker instead:

   a. `docker build . -t weather-ivr` to build the container using the dockerfile already in the repo.

   b. `docker run -d weather-ivr` to run it.
