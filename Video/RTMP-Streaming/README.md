# RTMP Outbound Streaming from a Programmable Video Conference

SignalWire's JavaScript Video SDK supports outbound streaming from a video conference room to an external RTMP URL.

This example uses a [Programmable Video Conference](https://developer.signalwire.com/guides/video-conferences) (PVC) and the [SignalWire Video SDK for Javascript](https://developer.signalwire.com/sdks/reference/browser-sdk/video/) to create a PVC with the ability to stream to an external site such as YouTube, Facebook, or Twitch.

## Prerequisites

To run this demo, you need to find the RTMP URL from whichever streaming service you want to stream to. The URL is usually on a live stream setup page. On YouTube, that page looks like this:

![YouTube live stream page](./yt-streaming.webp)

Some streaming services have a stream key in addition to the URL. If your service includes a stream key, note that as well. The final RTMP URL you will need to use concatenates the two with a / like this: `rtmp://<stream_url>/<stream_key>`.

## Running the Application
