# Voice Guides

[Answering Machine Detection with Ruby](./Answering%20Machine%20Detection%20with%20Ruby/)  
In Ruby, you can set up Answering Machine Detection when initiating a call. The detection will determine if the call is answered by a human or a machine. If it detects a machine, it will pause and then play a message. If it detects a human, it will connect the call to a representative.

[Appointment Reminder with NodeJS and Relay](./Appointment%20Reminder%20using%20NodeJS%20and%20Relay%20V3/)  
Using the Realtime SDK, this application will send custom text-to-speech calls to a number, then gather input to confirm or request changes to an appointment. If confirmed, a notification will be sent to the callee UI. If not confirmed, the call is redirected to an agent's number to reschedule.

[Appointment Reminder with Ruby](./Make%20Appointment%20Reminder%20Calls%20with%20Ruby/)  
This demo uses Ruby and Sinatra to create a fully functioning call reminder system. It will place a call, accept both DTMF and speech input, and use TTS to speak dates and times correctly. If the user changes their appointment to one of the slots we offer, we will also send them a reminder SMS.

[Call Center with Python and JSON Menus](./Call%20Center%20with%20Dynamic%20JSON%20Menus%20and%20Python/)  
This demo call center adds features to the [Dynamic IVR](./Build%20a%20Dynamic%20IVR%20with%20JSON%20Menus%20-%20Python/) demo also in this repository. It shows a wide array of IVR tools to build a full-featured call center.

[Coaching and Recording with NodeJS](./Implement%20Coaching%20and%20Recording%20with%20NodeJS/)  
Implement Coaching and Recording with Node.js. Coaching will connect a call to an in-progress conference so a supervisor can join a recorded conference call in progress between an agent and a customer.

[Dial by Voice with Python](./Dial%20By%20Voice%20Python/)  
This Python application will prompt the caller for a phone number via speech input and connect to the phone number recognized using ASR providing an additional level of accessibility for users.

[Dynamic IVR with Python and JSON Menus](./Build%20a%20Dynamic%20IVR%20with%20JSON%20Menus%20-%20Python/)  
This example demonstrates how you can use a JSON-defined menu to easily create an IVR Phone System with Python & Flask.

[IVR Including Voicemails sent to Email with NodeJS](./Voicemails%20to%20Email%20IVR%20with%20NodeJS/)  
Using Node.js, this application implements a phone tree IVR that includes parallel dialing to multiple phone numbers, a dynamic greeting, recording and transcribing voicemail, and sending recordings and transcriptions via email and sms.

[Multi-Factor Authentication with Ruby](./Multi-Factor%20Authentication%20in%20Ruby/)  
This demo implements a simple flow to showcase SignalWire's multi-factor authentication API in a Ruby environment.

[Phone Survey with Python](./Phone%20Survey%20With%20Python/)  
This application creates a survey that can be used inbound or outbound and then uses Google Sheets to store results.

[Record Audio Tracks with Websockets](./Recording%20Audio%20Tracks%20with%20Websockets/)  
This demo takes inbound and outbound audio tracks from a call and saves them to a wav file which can be stored to use later as simple playbacks or further manipulated for other purposes.

[Request Callback in a Queue with Python](./Request%20Callback%20in%20a%20Queue%20with%20Python/)  
Using Python, this application allows customers to call in and press a digit or send a text to request a callback when the next agent is available.

[Screen Calls Based on a Block List with Python](./Screen%20Calls%20Based%20on%20Block%20List%20with%20Python/)  
This demo screens incoming calls by checking the incoming "from" number against a list of offending numbers.

[Screen Calls and Record Voicemails with PHP](./Screen%20Calls%20%26%20Record%20Voicemail%20in%20PHP/)  
This PHP application screens incoming calls using a text-to-speech prompt and directs the call to either voicemail or a live agent depending on the caller's answer.

[Sentiment Analysis with Python](./Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20Python/)  
This is a demonstration of sentiment analysis. A phone number will accept calls and send audio to an NLP service and return a sentiment score in real-time. This allows you to determine the best way to respond to the customer and direct calls depending on the customer's needs.

[SIP Voicemail with NodeJS](./SIP%20Voicemail%20with%20NodeJS/)  
Set up a simple voicemail system for your SIP endpoint.

[Two-Factor Authentication with Python](./Implement%20two-factor%20with%20Python/)  
This Python example generates a one-time password via voice call. The same application demonstrates the auth validation with a call back to the same number.

[Weather Phone IVR with NodeJS](./Weather%20Phone%20IVR%20-%20NodeJS/)  
This is a fun example that uses Node.js to build an IVR that will report the current weather in Washington DC to a caller either as a phone call or a text message depending on user input. It is a useful example of how to build an IVR with our Realtime Relay SDK.
